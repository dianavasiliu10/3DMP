# Homework 1

The objects that were tasked for the first homework were a vase and a 3D pixel art keychain that must be sized according to these dimensions: 
10cm(X) x 7cm(Y) x 1cm(Z)

The folder contains .stl and .f3d files of the modeled objects and screenshots of the sliced objects in the Prusa Slicer.
